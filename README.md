# finalProject
final project for my bachelor's degree

======================================

This project is about thermodynamic properties interpolation with 3 use cases.

1. Interpolation for Saturated phase properties => use Pressure

2. Interpolation for Non - Saturated phase properties => use Pressure and Temperature

3. Reverse Calculation for Temperature => use {ressure and any Thermodynamic properties

(2) and (3) rely on thermodynamic properties table in Excel file.

P.S. integrate function is for merging all three function together.
